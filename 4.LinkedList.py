# Array takes lot of operation (n) for the simple operation 
# i.e inserting data at first index 

# In linked List it takes specifit i no of operation for inserting or deliting element in ith index 
#  Benifit of Linked List over Array 
# - You don't need to preallocate space
# - Insertion is easy 

# Doubled Linked List 
# It not only have a link to its next element but also have a link to its previous element 
# Forward and backward traversal becomes very easy
